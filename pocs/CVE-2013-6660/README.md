Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Go to http://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/dnd/all_types_of_import.html
2. Drag files (not directories) onto the drop area

What is the expected behavior?
The file should be interpreted and read correctly.
event.dataTransfer.items should read all files and be of length equal to the number of files. Also, event.dataTransfer.files should read all files and be of length equal to the number of files.

What went wrong?
event.dataTransfer.items reads an additional DataTransferItem as a string (the url of the file if available), meaning event.dataTransfer.items.length == (numFiles + 1) and event.dataTransfer.files.length == (numFiles).
This is changed functionality from Chrome Version 31.
