Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Refer attached WAST_BUGGY.txt. Note the signature of __testfunmangled
2. Note how this function is getting called
3. Note the statement immediately after the call site (if it matters for code generation inside chrome). The second last argument passed is 650.1 (say) as printed immediately before this call
4. Note the definitions of helper functions
5. After The call in step 3, inside first line of function __testfunmangled the value of second last argument is garbage (eg 1e-34) as printed to console or seen in debug tools - BUG

What is the expected behavior?
In step 5, the expected behavior is the value should be same as passed by caller (650.1)
This works fine in Chrome 64 bit 
This works fine in Firefox 32 bit and all 64 bit browsers (Edge Insider, Safari TP, FF)

What went wrong?
After The call in step 3, inside first line of function __testfunmangled the value of second last argument is garbage (eg 1e-34) as printed to console or seen in debug tools - BUG

Did this work before? No

I tried to create a test case(see attached a.cpp) but the emscripten toolchain did not generate the same WASM instruction set as the actual large codebase - So compiling a.cpp does not cause the bug to reproduce. It is attached for illustration purpose only.
