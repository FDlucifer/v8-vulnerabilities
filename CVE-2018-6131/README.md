The following change implements a check that can be bypassed https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/837646 (bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=7232)

This fix appears to fix a use-after-free by not allowing WebAssembly tables to be changed during a WebAssembly call, but it is still possible to do this by creating a new WebAssembly Instance importing the table with a element section during a call to an import. I haven't been able to reproduce the original issue in bug 7232 (and I don't have permissions to view the bug), so I am filing this issue for the WebAssembly team to investigate.
